She had never been and we knew she would love it. I actually went on a hotel discount site and was given this hotel. I had been in the Portland location once and remember it being beautiful and have stayed at other Kimpton hotels and had great experiences. After receiving notice of our reservation I emailed their staff and informed them this trip was for a birthday and requested a room with 2 beds, hopefully towards the top. The assistant manager promptly replied and said that he could accommodate that request but the 2-bed options were lower and didn\\'t have the best views. He then offered to upgrade us for $40 to one of the suites on the top floor. Given that we got such a good deal on the hotel price it was a no-brainer. The suite was excellent with a king bed in the bedroom and a pullout queen sleeper sofa in the living area. Both rooms had their own TV\\'s and there was a curtain that could be drawn to separate the two areas. The room was very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was nice but wasn\\'t as lavish as some other 4-star hotels we\\'ve been to. All of the soaps and shampoos though were high-end and there was nothing lacking. That night the hotel staff also left a note in our room with a birthday card for our daughter which included a free in-room movie rental as well as an invitation to call down for a complimentary birthday cake. We called down and they brought up a delicious personal-sized chocolate cake with ice cream and a candle in it. She was very excited! Throughout our 2-night stay the staff continued to be amazing. We spent a lot of our time checking out Seattle attractions but each time we came back we were greeted warmly. There was a wine tasting each night in the lobby and the staff always offered to get my daughter a soft drink from the restaurant. There were bowls of chocolates around that we all enjoyed as well. If I had anything to add to the \"con\" side it would be that the views from this hotel aren\\'t as attractive as some others I\\'ve stayed at in Seattle. It\\'s only an 11-story building and there are taller buildings surrounding it. If you\\'re expecting a full city view or one of the water you may be disappointed. We also thought the cost of valet parking was a little much, coming to nearly $40 per night with taxes. I am sure this is on-par with other 4-star hotels but is pretty hard to justify. We opted to valet on Friday night but found street parking on Saturday night since parking is free on Sundays. Overall though, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend staying there. Even with getting our reservation through a third party site we were never treated differently and that says a lot about a place.',\n",

We always love staying at Kimpton hotels and have stayed at the Alexis Hotel and Hotel Vintage Park in Seattle, so this time we decide to try the Hotel Monaco. As expected, our stay was wonderful. When we arrived we were met by the bellman how helped with our luggage. This was helpful since we had brought our two Shih Thus with us. Check in was quick and in less than 5 minutes, the valet had our car and we were checked in and heading to our room. The room was very nice with a small living room that made it a little more than â€œjust a roomâ€�. We had room service the first night and the food was great and was delivered in less than 20 minutes. Evening turndown service got our room ready for the night including chocolates on the pillow. The hotel is in the perfect spot in Seattle because you can walk to Pikeâ€™s Market, the movies, the shopping center and even the tram to get you around town. The hotelâ€™s wine reception was great and we found others had brought their pets with them. Kimptonâ€™s â€œpet friendlyâ€� program is wonderful. We came back from running around one night and found a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our anniversary. Our three days went by much too fast and we really did not want to leave, but all good things must come to an end. The good news is we can always go back and know we will get great service.',\n",

The front desk lady provided great information (at a pace that was energetic but not rushed), helpful leading questions about the area, and major positive energy without bubbling or being insincere. The bellman was busy with another car when we arrived, but noticed the car in front right away and within a very short period met up with me at the reception desk to get the key from me. We stayed in one of the Monte Carlo suites -- great energizing decor. Comfortable living room area, seperated from bedroom by large drapes, which was great for reading the morning papers or sipping the wine from the lobby before heading out to dinner. The bath had plenty of counter space for both of us (though one sink). The bed was comfortable with a range of pillows, as well as seating arrangements including a nice, comfortable chair and a small, two person bench seat for shoes, dressing, etc. Our maid service did a great job with meticulous neatening up. We also had dinner one night in Sazarac, a New Orleans style restaurant where we encountered more of the same: normal people, working hard, to provide thoughtful, positive service. This included our host, who conscientiously got us a table and our waitress who was busy, friendly, informative and attentive. Monaco is a tremendous location: next door to Starbucks (though there is free coffee in the lobby in the mornings); a block from the Capitol Grill; and easy walking to the retail core. The room was very reasonably priced and we like service, but service at a bargain is even better!',\n",

              "   {'content': 'Just returned from 3 night stay over the Labor Day weekend at the Hotel Monaco Seattle. We met some friends of ours, who also stayed there in a separate room. The location was good for us and anyone who doesn\\'t have issues with moderate walking -- it was a multi-block walk to Pikes Market, the waterfront, etc. -- you do have up hill walking when you return to the hotel from Pikes Market or the waterfront, though we found some streets to be less steep than others (Union Street, for instance). From the moment we arrived at the hotel we found the staff to be friendly, professional and helpful, and this continued throughout our stay -- the valet, doorman, front desk reps, concierge, housekeeping, etc. Each time we were leaving the hotel, the front desk people would acknowledge us with pleasantries such as \"have a nice day\"; upon our return they would again acknowledge us with \"welcome back\", or something similar. The evening wine event in the lobby was a very nice touch. The overall feel of the hotel was that it was nicely decorated and clean and felt welcoming. The room was also nicely decorated and clean and larger than the average hotel room. There was ample comfortable seating, i.e. two upholstered chairs and a very comfortable desk chair at the large desk. Also, the room had multiple sources of bright lighting -- best lighting of any hotel we\\'ve stayed in. There was a nice size flat screen TV, stocked mini-fridge (items for purchase), stocked snack tray (also for purchase), and a room safe as well. Though coffee service is provided in the lobby each morning, there is no coffee service in the room, however, you can request a set-up for your room, if desired. The beds were extremely comfortable, i.e. the mattress, linens, comforter, and pillows. The air conditioner worked great and you are able to control the temp. to your liking from the in-room thermostat. The bathroom, too, was larger than usual. The shower head was to die for and with great water pressure, so you didn\\'t have to spend a longer-than-usual amount of time in the shower trying to shower with a trickle of water, as is the case in many hotels (especially important to those of us with longer, thicker hair). They also had a wall-mounted rack containing full-size pump bottles of shampoo, cream rinse, and liquid bath soap. A hair dryer was also provided. You should know ahead of time, as we did, that many of the rooms face directly towards another high rise, in close proximity, especially if you want a room with two beds versus a king; we were told that there are no two bed rooms not facing the building; besides not having a view or much natural light, this necessitates keeping your curtains closed for privacy -- but, again, at least there\\'s great lighting provided in the room. There are only two things I would add to my wish list for the hotel -- one is to have at least some two-bed rooms that don\\'t face a building and the second is to provide larger than the standard size bath towels. All in all, this was a terrific hotel experience and we will definitely return there on future trips. This was our first stay at a Kimpton Hotel but, based on this experience, it won\\'t be our last!',\n",

There were a couple issues with the service. We are members of the InTouch club and are supposed to get newspapers delivered to the room each day. We only got papers two of the five days. I asked the front desk after the fourth day, and they said \"well, there are other guests, and sometimes we run out, but there\\'s a whole bunch of papers over there against the wall\". Then, I didn\\'t get the paper the next day either. My young son was supposed to get a welcome gift as part of the InTouch club, but he received nothing. I asked about this the next morning, and they said there\\'s a box where kids can go chose something (we got a deck of cards). Also, for the morning tea/coffee service in the lobby, the black tea ran out very early each day as did the lemonade/tea in the afternoon. It seems there\\'s just a half hearted effort for these \"perks\". They should either support the service or not. Other than these things, the hotel was fine. The room was nice; the food in the restaurant was great. We loved our pet fish (Fred).',\n",

We used that link to upgrade, for free, to the Napua Tower. The Napua Tower is like the Executive Level. They have a good breakfast in the morning and appetizer in the evening. The service is great. House Keeping did a great job and our room was very clean. Another Tip - At The Whaler\\'s General Store in The Shops at Wailea (a short drive/walk from the Hotel) you can pick up some reasonably priced snacks, drinks and deli. I was surprised the prices on most items were cheaper than the local super markets in Kihei. Finally, the greeter at the front (Rose Sumibcay) was very cool.

The pricing is what the pricing is and I feel that if you stay here you should have known that going in and thus you are not allowed to complain. I found the staff to be very pleasant individually but something just doesn't click here? It may be that it is so large that it all just doesn't connect, or come together as complete. The grounds are spectacular and easy to navigate, just be prepared to walk. Take in all that is around you, there is plenty to look at! The pool area was crowded but it was not a problem finding chairs, even after 11:00 am. There is limited space around any pool no matter how big, if you want to be pool front get up and get out! There was lovely lawn area with plenty of chairs and it was just fine and a short walk to the pools...just wear your $@!#% flops, as the walkway is sooo hot! Not the GW's fault! The beach is shared by 3-4 hotels and, though lovely, it is not huge and it gets packed!!! We went into the ocean but parked ourselves by pool and lawn. We ate at Humu and the pool area restaurant. Humu, with the $40 coupons was a fairly reasonable value and a great atmosphere. We had 3 rooms so we had $120 worth of coupons. Our dinner for 6, after coupons, was just over $200! This included some apps and drinks. Don't drink as much as us and use your free drink coupons with dinner, not before, and it is even less! We all felt it very good. The pool area food and bar was as expected, just fine. My daughter loved the spa treatment and, again after using the 20% off coupon, thought it was reasonable at about $125 for a 50 minute message and one hour use of other facilities included. The gym was large and we were there at peak time and waited for no machine. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable. We were in the back building and on the 6th floor and had a great view! I liked the bed though others with us thought they were to soft. If you take the down mattress cover off, or ask housekeeping to, it will be more firm. One thing to note, the lovely bathrooms were adorned with a throw rug that had no rubber backing in front of the sink!!! REMOVE IT if they have not yet changed them all out. I took a pretty good fall, after ignoring a slip or two prior. I was lucky to only twist my ankle and bruise my elbow pretty good- enough to miss my scheduled golf event with son. I can only imagine if it was someone older or less able to control the fall. I mentioned this to front desk and though my rug was immediately changed out to one with rubber backing the other two rooms we had were not! I was clearly not the first by the look on the faces of those I mentioned it to. Though I was looking for nothing, I was surprised by the apparent lack of concern when discussed with security. Would I stay again, yes I would. It was a lovely place.\",\n",

When I checked in I was told that the room I booked (two double beds) was not available due to \"damage\" and they had put us in an ovean front room with one King bed and a pull out couch. I as disappointed about the change, but they discounted the upgrade by $10.00 per night, which I appreciated. When we got to our room on the 6th floor it was clean but not up to the standards of a room we would normally stay in. If I had paid full price for the stay I likely would have checked out right then and went someplace else. The shower head was pulled from the wall, corner molding pulled from the wall, faucet was leaking/dripping and the room just felt run-down. You can read the other reviews about the place needing updates, I agree. THe best part of the room was the view of the ocean, and my children really enjoyed that. My older son appreciated the free wi-fi and it worked well for him. The pool area was great and my younger son and I spent most of our time there. They really seem to put alot of effort into making sure he outside of this hotel looks nice. I would suggest that they do all the pool maintenance and cleaning of the area before the pool opens at 8 am. I had to move all of my stuff one morning so that a maintenance guy could hose down/wash the windows in the meeting area. I think he should have done this before the pool opened. I found the front desk/restaurant/bar staff to be very friendly and interesting to talk to. The staff is likely the best part of the hotel, followed by the pool area. In the end, I am glad I got over my initial dislike of the place because it ended up to be a good stay. I hope they continue with the upgrades and improvements.',\n",

I know from previous stays in nearby hotels the airplane noise is worse at other end Also was expecting a nice balcony but in reality it is only maybe 18\" wide, just enough to stand there. The good: Very good front desk, especially the women on 2nd shift (Silver?) decent bathroom, good bed, nice view, quick shuttle to the strip, room was fresh and not too heavy on air freshener like some places. The bad: Road traffic noise, road construction noise, airplane noise, noisey hum in room from hvac, noisey bar patrons in atrium, food and service in restaurant need some improvement, plates for breakfast buffet dirty, fitness center disapointing, two long black hairs in bathroom sink that were not mine, slight cigarette odor coming from bathroom vent',\n",

We came across Embassy Suites on Priceline and for a family of seven it worked great. The room had a living room/sm. kitchenette area and then a separate bedroom. The room would sleep 6 and we put the baby in his own playpen and also had the staff bring up a portable single bed. The kids loved the pool and their favorite part (and mine) was the made to order breakfast in the morning that was included in the price of the room. That kind of breakfast would have easily cost us $40 at a restaurant.

In a previous review I had read a complaint about possible noise from the tram line that runs outside the hotel, so I made sure we got a room at the back. This was very quiet and luxuriously appointed with a lovely large bathroom with a bath. The breakfast was very good indeed with a good selection of fruits breads pastries juices and cereals. The scrambled egg and bacon did not look so nice though but the rest was great. There are some nice reasonably priced restaurants near the hotel. I found the hotel to be a little far from the centre to walk so we got taxis everywhere. You can get a train from the airport but we didn’t want the humping of cases on and off the train and through the station. (You are too close to get a taxi from the station just one block down from Termini) So it would have been lugging cases down the street to the hotel. We decided to get a taxi from Fumicino airport. This is fixed rate of 40 Euros which is not bad for the convenience. You have to get a ticket from a desk just before you go out the door of the airport to make sure you get the 40 Euro fixed rate, otherwise the taxi will be on the meter. The Hotel can arrange a luxury car back to the airport for 45 Euro which we took on departure. Impressions of Rome: Visit the main attractions about two in the afternoon to avoid the queues. We only queued for 15 mins at St Peters and the same at the Colliseum. The Vatican Museum we walked straight in. You may as well give the Trevi fountain a miss as it’s just a horde of tourists. The Sistine chapel was fantastic and the highlight of our stay. Be sure to read up all about the painting on the ceiling before you go to truly appreciate it.',\n",

However when I checked in at the Rome property I was given a very small room which with my son\\'s roll away bed was simply impossible. Returned to the desk and was told nothing could be done went back to the room and tried to rearrange the furniture and it was still not going to work. Returned to front desk and told the rather cold and abrupt clerk that the room was unacceptable period--I was a corporate reservation and requested to speak to the manager on duty. This lady didn\\'t speak English but took one look at the reservation and directed the supercilious desk clerk to put us in a nice two room suite which was great! Thank you very much. The biggest issue most people will have with the hotel is the location--about two blocks from the train station. Not a high rent neighborhood. In fact I watched a homeless guy sit in a doorway across the street for three days and nights. At the historic baths a few blocks away I saw the mobile health service van giving the homeless Heroin addicts their \"treatments\". However, I never felt uncomfortable walking the local streets even after dark and there are some reasonable eateries just around the corner. Being installed in a suite probably skews my review...there was some street noise at night and there is full time security personnel in the lobby to keep out the riff raff but I found it comfortable and convenient with a nice free breakfast. My wife didn\\'t care for the location but even she felt the room was nice--especially with the three of us in it. I\\'d stay again--she says I should find a better located B&B sort of place.',\n",

The famous Big Beach is only minutes drive away. The facility is very carefully maintained. We saw people polishing the door knobs and stair rails every day. The garden inside the hotel is just stunning. The hotel is also big, very big. It can be good or bad depending on peopleâ€™s taste. But we find it very interesting because there is a lot to explore. The room we had was a deluxe ocean view room. It is very clean and has all the amenities you can think of. We have nothing to complain about the staff. They are very helpful and very knowledgeable about what to do and where to go on Maui. The food in the resort is expensive. Thatâ€™s about the only drawback I can think of.',\n",

              "   {'content': \"This Resort was totally Posh! I cannot understand the negative reviews. Yes, the restaurants are expensive. Yes, they do charge a lot of money. Have you people looked around though? Everything on Maui is expensive, especially the hotels. Every hotel charges about double for drinks. If you go to a restaurant and bar off hotel premises, you will find it a lot cheaper. It is not just the Grand Weilea that charges extra for everything. We stayed at two Hotels on our stay, one which was less stars than the other, and both were comparable when it came to restaurant food and drink. My wife and I are middle class, and we stayed at this resort for 5 days. When we got to the resort, we checked ourselves in and parked our own car to save a little money. We parked our own car everyday, because they charge you money per day to use valet. When we were checked in, we were given a choice for an upgrade, either a king bed or two queens with an ocean view. We chose the ocean view, and what a spectacular view it was. Very Nice! We were very Pleased! The Parking lot is further away if you park yourself, but it was worth a few dollars saved. All resorts charge extra for their daily resort fee, and this is extra in addition to your trip fee, whether it is expedia, unitedvacations, or whatever, so expect it when you go. The Service: Excellent As said above, all you had to do was ask, and you were accomodated. We did not like the puffy pillows in the rooms, so we asked for flatter pillows in our room from housekeeping, and were immediately accomodated. On the beach, staff would help you grab chairs, give you as many towels as you wanted, and it was not too much trouble to ask for anything. Water was free all over the premises. they had tanks w/ cups everywhere. Everyone said hello, or Aloha, or Mahalo. The Room: We were upgraded to Oceanview with two Queens. The view was amazing, and the bathroom came with a two person soaking tub, and a glass enclosed shower, which could easily fit 3 persons if you wanted. Mini bar and frig accompanied the room, and it was very tempting not to use the mini bar, but it was just too expensive. We went to the Weilea village, and were able to buy liqour and beer for less than half the price of the mini bar contents. One should expect the mini bar to be high priced though. There are complimentary robes in the room. the beds are simply plushible comfortability. The Lanai comes with two chairs and a table. The room comes with free internet via internet cable provided. Housekeeping comes twice a day, once in the morning to clean, and once in the evening to provide turn down service. I suggest leaving a couple dollars tip at least, and they will treat you right. Bell men insisted upon helping with the luggage, which we felt was very nice even though we were pretty much doing it ourselves anyway. They also have the Napua Tower, which has its own wing with it's own continental breakfast, and its own Hour d oevers and wine nightly, and also its own concierge. obviously we did not stay here, but passed by it on the way to our room everyday, and wondered about its amenities. it is available for extra dollars of course. The Service: Above Par: Now if you rent one of the cabanas for a cost on the lawn, you will have someone to wait on you and they will bring you frozen grapes all day, but we did not spend the money on the cabana. If you ask the waiter or waitresses for drinks while you are sitting in chairs though, they will gladly accomodate. We did not order too many drinks though because they are really expensive, which we knew going in (12 dollars/mixed drink). If you didn't know this going in, I guess I could see how you could react poorly, but when you go to a resort this size, you should really do a little research. We used chairs on the beach at no cost. Really, the cabanas were not worth the money unless you have a medical condition that prevents you from being in the sun. The Spa: All we heard about when we were at the Resort was how great the Spa was. We did not use it, but apprently it is rated one of the best around. We thought about it several times, but did not want to spend the extra money since we were spending so much already. Beach and Pools: Beach is rated best in the nation many times. I have even seen it on the Travel Channel at Home. Snorkel excursions visit nearby because of all the turtles, and because of it being such a great snorkel site. The beach is pretty much immaculate, with lawn and laying chairs available, nice white sand and fairly calm waters. The pool is in itself just freaking amazing. There are a bunch of pools on a $@!#%, and all are connected by several waterslides, two big ones being the main attractions. Between the two big waterslides is the worlds only water elevator, which takes you to the top of one of the big waterslides. We understood what we paid when we saw and rode in the water elevator. There is an adult habiscus pool which is luke warm rather than the cold water pools near the bottom. There are two adult hot tubs near the adult hibiscus pool, and there is also a massage therapist near the hibiscus pool which is avaiable for a charge. there are probably a total of 5-7 hot tubs, and also several pools. there is a kiddy beach for the kids right off of the regular beach, which is made to be safer, and is really a pool/beach for the children. There are lifeguards all around. The Land: They have about 15 million dollars put into their art work. They have tours of the resort for free just to view their art work if you like that sort of thing. They also have tours for the Flowers and landscape where they explain all that to you if you like that sort of thing also. Eating: We ate and drank very rarely at the hotels we stayed at because it was so expensive. The other hotel we stayed at was the Sheraton. It was also very very nice, and we would go back to either hotel, but the drinking and eating at both places was expensive, so we planned ahead wear to eat and drink by using Maui books bought in different stores. We sprang a little and ate breakfast once at the Grand Weilea in the Grand Dining Room the last morning we were there. My wife is a big breakfast fan, so we tried it. It was $28 pp, and even though it was a huge breakfast, and it included a lot of food, it still was not worth the dollars. That is why we planned ahead to eat off of the resorts. Other: Most people we talked to did not leave the resort, but we knew better. We did the Road to Hana, The Pipwai trail, another hike walk, and viewed many of the beaches North of Kannapali. We also did a Trilogy excurion for our Snorkel trip, and it took us to Molokini, where the water was clear about 50 feet down. We both agreed we had never seen water as clear before, and we have both snorkeled a couple of times before. Trilogy was awesome, fed us breakfast and lunch, and snacks in between, and was always asking us if we needed more to drink. I highly recommend Trilogy! You will need a car on the island if you are going off the resort. It is a negative if you do not get out of your hotel room. If you are not squeemish in the Car, do the Road to Hana, and go to the 7 Sacred Pools, and walk the Pipiwai trail (2 miles one way) Follow the pics and paragraphs in Maui Revealed. It was definitely our little blue book on this trip. Overall: If you go to Maui, I highly recommend that you do you reserach, and plan ahead. Otherwise, you will feel like a lot of others on this site that you were nickel and dimed beyond belief. If you don't expect to spend more than you think, then you will feel like you were shorted. We had an awesome Vacation staying at two hotels that were awesome. We expected to pay more than what we did up front, so expect that from the beginning. Email me for your questions or for pictures. I have a ton of them.\",\n",

We love Baltimore and all there is to do there, but more importantly than the town is the place -- and this is it! There is just this feeling of \"ahhh\" as you walk in, feeling like you\\'ve just entered the home of a dear friend. From the welcoming lobby (and front desk staff) to the wine in your room to the beautiful furnishings, you\\'ll know within ten minutes of your arrival that you picked the right place! The rooms are very large and furnished like a bedroom out of a model home. You will not feel in the least like you are staying in a hotel! The mattresses and sheets are top of the line -- you\\'ll get a wonderful night\\'s sleep! The breakfast is just incredible with every sort of fresh fruit, crunchy granola, a large assortment of fresh breads and pastries, cheese and crackers, many fresh fruits -- you name it, it\\'s there! I took pictures but somehow they got deleted from my camera card and I\\'m very disappointed because I\\'ve described this place to my friends, but it\\'s not until they saw the pictures on my camera that they realized how truly unique and wonderful this place is. The front desk staff will attend to your every need and are so gracious and pleasant to deal with. The Inn at Henderson\\'s Wharf combines the best of a Bed and Breakfast (charm, good food, warm ambiance) with the privacy and luxury of an upscale hotel. The water taxi comes within a few minutes of the front door -- it gets you wherever you want to go in Baltimore within minutes at a very low cost. We would never consider staying anywhere else when we\\'re in Baltimore and in fact consider the Inn a destination in itself!',\n",

In a nutshell - rude bell staff (note I will not tip poor service and bad attitudes just because you expect it), rude front desk staff and staff who had to be kept out of the room - you may have been desperate to clean it but check out is 12 (and no later). This hotel has the smallest hotel room I have ever seen in the USA. Poor beyond words. Great location but that's all it's got going for it (don't be hopeful from the grand entrance and internet pictures!)\",\n",

The hotel touts its own history and though nice, I was not particularly impressed overall. The Park Plaza seemed almost as though it was trying to be too many things to too many people...more than one wedding booked (large lighted ,glossy photos and names of couples in lobby detracting from the historic decor), lots of high maintenance vacationers, European travelers, even airline flight crews. Amid the shuffle, I felt a bit overlooked as a lone traveler. At one point, I waited in a long line for the Concierge to ask for a walkable map of the historic African-American sites trail, only to be told hurriedly that they didn\\'t have any but \"the trail starts on the other side of the park\". The group in front of me in line however, booked a boat tour, made dinner reservations for a family of 4, and got directions from the Concierge. All I wanted was a map. Maybe it would have been better had I not been traveling in the middle of the summer? In any case, the rooms have a nice historic flair (skeleton key doors) and are small but perfectly acceptable. The room was clean but my bed sheet was stained, which was pretty unexpected considering the caliber of the hotel. Overall, I could not have asked for a better location and for the seasoned traveler who needs little direction or attention, it was a reasonable choice.',\n",

Upon check in, there were no junior suites, so we were upgraded to some fabulous 2-room suite on the 15th floor of the Towers. It was lovely and the 15th floor suites include complimentary evening appetizers and morning breakfast. The 2-room suite accomodated us nicely and we were very gracious for the upgrade. However, the airconditioning would not go below 77-degrees (It was set to be 64-degrees when we arrived)!. Granted, on day one, Boston got hit by the near 100-degree heat wave. On day 2, i made 3 requests between 9 am and 10:45 pm for the AC to be looked at and i also requested a portable fan for the room. Sleeping night number one was miserable, difficult and hot! Anyhow, after my 3rd request for assistance, and it was now 11:15 PM and I needed to go to bed, so i walked down to the front desk and nicely explained my unhappiness and discomfort. The desk clerk appologized profusely and gave me her portable box fan from behind the counter. I was happy to have a fan at last, but displeased that my 3 earlier requests were disregarded. On day number 3 the room temp with AC would still only go down to 77, although the weather out was pleasant and mildat 78-degrees. We opened our windows and slept with them open because it was cooler out than in. All other aspects of the hotel were grand. The location right by a T station and 1 block from the Boston Public Garden can't be beat. The hotel is not cheap to stay at, and we were still paying a good chunk of change to stay there regardless of recieving an upgrade, so it is not accecptable to disregard a guests request for room comfort. Still, despite the AC situation, I would recommend this hotel and I would stay there again.\",\n",

I had the most wonderful massage on the 73rd floor Bliss spa (I used my Starwood points to pay for it.). The hotel is located in West Kowloon, a part of the International Commerce Center development, is in the heart of HK's financial district where you have access to all the shops and restaurants you'll ever need. You are also at the West Kowloon station of the MTR (subway) which is easy and convenient. Lastly, you can check in for most airlines right there for the In-town check in. (Meaning you can drop off your luggage right there!!) and take the airport train to the airport. A huge time savings. I will definitely stay here on future visits to HK.\",\n",

The room was spacious enough to ensure we were all comfortable, and everything was of very high quality. The cot for the baby was excellent and the big bed was super comfortable. Amenities were good and everything was fairly functional (though perhaps they do tend to err more on the side of design rather than functionality, but that's ok). Staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. They are obviously well trained and are keen to help customers. Food was fairly good. The only thing to consider carefully is the location. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere but does enjoy very good views of the harbour on one side (though partly obscured by the massive ICC tower) and is close to a shopping mall if that's what you're interested in. Everything is within quick reach by taxi though, and the hotel cars and drivers are also outstanding and affordable. Another odd arrangement is the reception... when you arrive you have to catch a lift to the 6th floor and get out. That's where reception is. Then you catch another lift to the room floors. A bit tiring after a while, especially when travelling with kids (though I'm being picky here). There was wireless internet but it wasn't cheap. Finally, you must check out the pool at the top. Fantastic spot with a stunning view! The pool was closed for a few weeks until January 20120 but is not open again. Overall, we had a great stay here, enjoyed the cool design and decor, as well as the great service and hospitality, and would probably recommend it to others.\",\n",

              "  'reviews': [{'content': 'My girlfriend and I decided to surprise our 11-year-old daughter with a trip to Seattle for her birthday this last weekend. She had never been and we knew she would love it. I actually went on a hotel discount site and was given this hotel. I had been in the Portland location once and remember it being beautiful and have stayed at other Kimpton hotels and had great experiences. After receiving notice of our reservation I emailed their staff and informed them this trip was for a birthday and requested a room with 2 beds, hopefully towards the top. The assistant manager promptly replied and said that he could accommodate that request but the 2-bed options were lower and didn\\'t have the best views. He then offered to upgrade us for $40 to one of the suites on the top floor. Given that we got such a good deal on the hotel price it was a no-brainer. The suite was excellent with a king bed in the bedroom and a pullout queen sleeper sofa in the living area. Both rooms had their own TV\\'s and there was a curtain that could be drawn to separate the two areas. The room was very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was nice but wasn\\'t as lavish as some other 4-star hotels we\\'ve been to. All of the soaps and shampoos though were high-end and there was nothing lacking. That night the hotel staff also left a note in our room with a birthday card for our daughter which included a free in-room movie rental as well as an invitation to call down for a complimentary birthday cake. We called down and they brought up a delicious personal-sized chocolate cake with ice cream and a candle in it. She was very excited! Throughout our 2-night stay the staff continued to be amazing. We spent a lot of our time checking out Seattle attractions but each time we came back we were greeted warmly. There was a wine tasting each night in the lobby and the staff always offered to get my daughter a soft drink from the restaurant. There were bowls of chocolates around that we all enjoyed as well. If I had anything to add to the \"con\" side it would be that the views from this hotel aren\\'t as attractive as some others I\\'ve stayed at in Seattle. It\\'s only an 11-story building and there are taller buildings surrounding it. If you\\'re expecting a full city view or one of the water you may be disappointed. We also thought the cost of valet parking was a little much, coming to nearly $40 per night with taxes. I am sure this is on-par with other 4-star hotels but is pretty hard to justify. We opted to valet on Friday night but found street parking on Saturday night since parking is free on Sundays. Overall though, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend staying there. Even with getting our reservation through a third party site we were never treated differently and that says a lot about a place.',\n",

We always love staying at Kimpton hotels and have stayed at the Alexis Hotel and Hotel Vintage Park in Seattle, so this time we decide to try the Hotel Monaco. As expected, our stay was wonderful. When we arrived we were met by the bellman how helped with our luggage. This was helpful since we had brought our two Shih Thus with us. Check in was quick and in less than 5 minutes, the valet had our car and we were checked in and heading to our room. The room was very nice with a small living room that made it a little more than â€œjust a roomâ€�. We had room service the first night and the food was great and was delivered in less than 20 minutes. Evening turndown service got our room ready for the night including chocolates on the pillow. The hotel is in the perfect spot in Seattle because you can walk to Pikeâ€™s Market, the movies, the shopping center and even the tram to get you around town. The hotelâ€™s wine reception was great and we found others had brought their pets with them. Kimptonâ€™s â€œpet friendlyâ€� program is wonderful. We came back from running around one night and found a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our anniversary. Our three days went by much too fast and we really did not want to leave, but all good things must come to an end. The good news is we can always go back and know we will get great service.',\n",

The front desk lady provided great information (at a pace that was energetic but not rushed), helpful leading questions about the area, and major positive energy without bubbling or being insincere. The bellman was busy with another car when we arrived, but noticed the car in front right away and within a very short period met up with me at the reception desk to get the key from me. We stayed in one of the Monte Carlo suites -- great energizing decor. Comfortable living room area, seperated from bedroom by large drapes, which was great for reading the morning papers or sipping the wine from the lobby before heading out to dinner. The bath had plenty of counter space for both of us (though one sink). The bed was comfortable with a range of pillows, as well as seating arrangements including a nice, comfortable chair and a small, two person bench seat for shoes, dressing, etc. Our maid service did a great job with meticulous neatening up. We also had dinner one night in Sazarac, a New Orleans style restaurant where we encountered more of the same: normal people, working hard, to provide thoughtful, positive service. This included our host, who conscientiously got us a table and our waitress who was busy, friendly, informative and attentive. Monaco is a tremendous location: next door to Starbucks (though there is free coffee in the lobby in the mornings); a block from the Capitol Grill; and easy walking to the retail core. The room was very reasonably priced and we like service, but service at a bargain is even better!',\n",

              "   {'content': 'Just returned from 3 night stay over the Labor Day weekend at the Hotel Monaco Seattle. We met some friends of ours, who also stayed there in a separate room. The location was good for us and anyone who doesn\\'t have issues with moderate walking -- it was a multi-block walk to Pikes Market, the waterfront, etc. -- you do have up hill walking when you return to the hotel from Pikes Market or the waterfront, though we found some streets to be less steep than others (Union Street, for instance). From the moment we arrived at the hotel we found the staff to be friendly, professional and helpful, and this continued throughout our stay -- the valet, doorman, front desk reps, concierge, housekeeping, etc. Each time we were leaving the hotel, the front desk people would acknowledge us with pleasantries such as \"have a nice day\"; upon our return they would again acknowledge us with \"welcome back\", or something similar. The evening wine event in the lobby was a very nice touch. The overall feel of the hotel was that it was nicely decorated and clean and felt welcoming. The room was also nicely decorated and clean and larger than the average hotel room. There was ample comfortable seating, i.e. two upholstered chairs and a very comfortable desk chair at the large desk. Also, the room had multiple sources of bright lighting -- best lighting of any hotel we\\'ve stayed in. There was a nice size flat screen TV, stocked mini-fridge (items for purchase), stocked snack tray (also for purchase), and a room safe as well. Though coffee service is provided in the lobby each morning, there is no coffee service in the room, however, you can request a set-up for your room, if desired. The beds were extremely comfortable, i.e. the mattress, linens, comforter, and pillows. The air conditioner worked great and you are able to control the temp. to your liking from the in-room thermostat. The bathroom, too, was larger than usual. The shower head was to die for and with great water pressure, so you didn\\'t have to spend a longer-than-usual amount of time in the shower trying to shower with a trickle of water, as is the case in many hotels (especially important to those of us with longer, thicker hair). They also had a wall-mounted rack containing full-size pump bottles of shampoo, cream rinse, and liquid bath soap. A hair dryer was also provided. You should know ahead of time, as we did, that many of the rooms face directly towards another high rise, in close proximity, especially if you want a room with two beds versus a king; we were told that there are no two bed rooms not facing the building; besides not having a view or much natural light, this necessitates keeping your curtains closed for privacy -- but, again, at least there\\'s great lighting provided in the room. There are only two things I would add to my wish list for the hotel -- one is to have at least some two-bed rooms that don\\'t face a building and the second is to provide larger than the standard size bath towels. All in all, this was a terrific hotel experience and we will definitely return there on future trips. This was our first stay at a Kimpton Hotel but, based on this experience, it won\\'t be our last!',\n",

There were a couple issues with the service. We are members of the InTouch club and are supposed to get newspapers delivered to the room each day. We only got papers two of the five days. I asked the front desk after the fourth day, and they said \"well, there are other guests, and sometimes we run out, but there\\'s a whole bunch of papers over there against the wall\". Then, I didn\\'t get the paper the next day either. My young son was supposed to get a welcome gift as part of the InTouch club, but he received nothing. I asked about this the next morning, and they said there\\'s a box where kids can go chose something (we got a deck of cards). Also, for the morning tea/coffee service in the lobby, the black tea ran out very early each day as did the lemonade/tea in the afternoon. It seems there\\'s just a half hearted effort for these \"perks\". They should either support the service or not. Other than these things, the hotel was fine. The room was nice; the food in the restaurant was great. We loved our pet fish (Fred).',\n",

We used that link to upgrade, for free, to the Napua Tower. The Napua Tower is like the Executive Level. They have a good breakfast in the morning and appetizer in the evening. The service is great. House Keeping did a great job and our room was very clean. Another Tip - At The Whaler\\'s General Store in The Shops at Wailea (a short drive/walk from the Hotel) you can pick up some reasonably priced snacks, drinks and deli. I was surprised the prices on most items were cheaper than the local super markets in Kihei. Finally, the greeter at the front (Rose Sumibcay) was very cool.

The pricing is what the pricing is and I feel that if you stay here you should have known that going in and thus you are not allowed to complain. I found the staff to be very pleasant individually but something just doesn't click here? It may be that it is so large that it all just doesn't connect, or come together as complete. The grounds are spectacular and easy to navigate, just be prepared to walk. Take in all that is around you, there is plenty to look at! The pool area was crowded but it was not a problem finding chairs, even after 11:00 am. There is limited space around any pool no matter how big, if you want to be pool front get up and get out! There was lovely lawn area with plenty of chairs and it was just fine and a short walk to the pools...just wear your $@!#% flops, as the walkway is sooo hot! Not the GW's fault! The beach is shared by 3-4 hotels and, though lovely, it is not huge and it gets packed!!! We went into the ocean but parked ourselves by pool and lawn. We ate at Humu and the pool area restaurant. Humu, with the $40 coupons was a fairly reasonable value and a great atmosphere. We had 3 rooms so we had $120 worth of coupons. Our dinner for 6, after coupons, was just over $200! This included some apps and drinks. Don't drink as much as us and use your free drink coupons with dinner, not before, and it is even less! We all felt it very good. The pool area food and bar was as expected, just fine. My daughter loved the spa treatment and, again after using the 20% off coupon, thought it was reasonable at about $125 for a 50 minute message and one hour use of other facilities included. The gym was large and we were there at peak time and waited for no machine. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable. We were in the back building and on the 6th floor and had a great view! I liked the bed though others with us thought they were to soft. If you take the down mattress cover off, or ask housekeeping to, it will be more firm. One thing to note, the lovely bathrooms were adorned with a throw rug that had no rubber backing in front of the sink!!! REMOVE IT if they have not yet changed them all out. I took a pretty good fall, after ignoring a slip or two prior. I was lucky to only twist my ankle and bruise my elbow pretty good- enough to miss my scheduled golf event with son. I can only imagine if it was someone older or less able to control the fall. I mentioned this to front desk and though my rug was immediately changed out to one with rubber backing the other two rooms we had were not! I was clearly not the first by the look on the faces of those I mentioned it to. Though I was looking for nothing, I was surprised by the apparent lack of concern when discussed with security. Would I stay again, yes I would. It was a lovely place.\",\n",

When I checked in I was told that the room I booked (two double beds) was not available due to \"damage\" and they had put us in an ovean front room with one King bed and a pull out couch. I as disappointed about the change, but they discounted the upgrade by $10.00 per night, which I appreciated. When we got to our room on the 6th floor it was clean but not up to the standards of a room we would normally stay in. If I had paid full price for the stay I likely would have checked out right then and went someplace else. The shower head was pulled from the wall, corner molding pulled from the wall, faucet was leaking/dripping and the room just felt run-down. You can read the other reviews about the place needing updates, I agree. THe best part of the room was the view of the ocean, and my children really enjoyed that. My older son appreciated the free wi-fi and it worked well for him. The pool area was great and my younger son and I spent most of our time there. They really seem to put alot of effort into making sure he outside of this hotel looks nice. I would suggest that they do all the pool maintenance and cleaning of the area before the pool opens at 8 am. I had to move all of my stuff one morning so that a maintenance guy could hose down/wash the windows in the meeting area. I think he should have done this before the pool opened. I found the front desk/restaurant/bar staff to be very friendly and interesting to talk to. The staff is likely the best part of the hotel, followed by the pool area. In the end, I am glad I got over my initial dislike of the place because it ended up to be a good stay. I hope they continue with the upgrades and improvements.',\n",

The good: Very good front desk, especially the women on 2nd shift (Silver?) decent bathroom, good bed, nice view, quick shuttle to the strip, room was fresh and not too heavy on air freshener like some places. The bad: Road traffic noise, road construction noise, airplane noise, noisey hum in room from hvac, noisey bar patrons in atrium, food and service in restaurant need some improvement, plates for breakfast buffet dirty, fitness center disapointing, two long black hairs in bathroom sink that were not mine, slight cigarette odor coming from bathroom vent',\n",

The room would sleep 6 and we put the baby in his own playpen and also had the staff bring up a portable single bed. The kids loved the pool and their favorite part (and mine) was the made to order breakfast in the morning that was included in the price of the room. That kind of breakfast would have easily cost us $40 at a restaurant.

In a previous review I had read a complaint about possible noise from the tram line that runs outside the hotel, so I made sure we got a room at the back. This was very quiet and luxuriously appointed with a lovely large bathroom with a bath. The breakfast was very good indeed with a good selection of fruits breads pastries juices and cereals. The scrambled egg and bacon did not look so nice though but the rest was great. There are some nice reasonably priced restaurants near the hotel. I found the hotel to be a little far from the centre to walk so we got taxis everywhere. You can get a train from the airport but we didn’t want the humping of cases on and off the train and through the station. (You are too close to get a taxi from the station just one block down from Termini) So it would have been lugging cases down the street to the hotel. We decided to get a taxi from Fumicino airport. This is fixed rate of 40 Euros which is not bad for the convenience. You have to get a ticket from a desk just before you go out the door of the airport to make sure you get the 40 Euro fixed rate, otherwise the taxi will be on the meter. The Hotel can arrange a luxury car back to the airport for 45 Euro which we took on departure. Impressions of Rome: Visit the main attractions about two in the afternoon to avoid the queues. We only queued for 15 mins at St Peters and the same at the Colliseum. The Vatican Museum we walked straight in. You may as well give the Trevi fountain a miss as it’s just a horde of tourists. The Sistine chapel was fantastic and the highlight of our stay. Be sure to read up all about the painting on the ceiling before you go to truly appreciate it.',\n",

The biggest issue most people will have with the hotel is the location--about two blocks from the train station. Not a high rent neighborhood. In fact I watched a homeless guy sit in a doorway across the street for three days and nights. At the historic baths a few blocks away I saw the mobile health service van giving the homeless Heroin addicts their \"treatments\". However, I never felt uncomfortable walking the local streets even after dark and there are some reasonable eateries just around the corner. Being installed in a suite probably skews my review...there was some street noise at night and there is full time security personnel in the lobby to keep out the riff raff but I found it comfortable and convenient with a nice free breakfast. My wife didn\\'t care for the location but even she felt the room was nice--especially with the three of us in it. I\\'d stay again--she says I should find a better located B&B sort of place.',\n",

The famous Big Beach is only minutes drive away. The facility is very carefully maintained. We saw people polishing the door knobs and stair rails every day. The garden inside the hotel is just stunning. The hotel is also big, very big. It can be good or bad depending on peopleâ€™s taste. But we find it very interesting because there is a lot to explore. The room we had was a deluxe ocean view room. It is very clean and has all the amenities you can think of. We have nothing to complain about the staff. They are very helpful and very knowledgeable about what to do and where to go on Maui. The food in the resort is expensive. Thatâ€™s about the only drawback I can think of.',\n",

              "   {'content': \"This Resort was totally Posh! I cannot understand the negative reviews. Yes, the restaurants are expensive. Yes, they do charge a lot of money. Have you people looked around though? Everything on Maui is expensive, especially the hotels. Every hotel charges about double for drinks. If you go to a restaurant and bar off hotel premises, you will find it a lot cheaper. It is not just the Grand Weilea that charges extra for everything. We stayed at two Hotels on our stay, one which was less stars than the other, and both were comparable when it came to restaurant food and drink. My wife and I are middle class, and we stayed at this resort for 5 days. When we got to the resort, we checked ourselves in and parked our own car to save a little money. We parked our own car everyday, because they charge you money per day to use valet. When we were checked in, we were given a choice for an upgrade, either a king bed or two queens with an ocean view. We chose the ocean view, and what a spectacular view it was. Very Nice! We were very Pleased! The Parking lot is further away if you park yourself, but it was worth a few dollars saved. All resorts charge extra for their daily resort fee, and this is extra in addition to your trip fee, whether it is expedia, unitedvacations, or whatever, so expect it when you go. The Service: Excellent As said above, all you had to do was ask, and you were accomodated. We did not like the puffy pillows in the rooms, so we asked for flatter pillows in our room from housekeeping, and were immediately accomodated. On the beach, staff would help you grab chairs, give you as many towels as you wanted, and it was not too much trouble to ask for anything. Water was free all over the premises. they had tanks w/ cups everywhere. Everyone said hello, or Aloha, or Mahalo. The Room: We were upgraded to Oceanview with two Queens. The view was amazing, and the bathroom came with a two person soaking tub, and a glass enclosed shower, which could easily fit 3 persons if you wanted. Mini bar and frig accompanied the room, and it was very tempting not to use the mini bar, but it was just too expensive. We went to the Weilea village, and were able to buy liqour and beer for less than half the price of the mini bar contents. One should expect the mini bar to be high priced though. There are complimentary robes in the room. the beds are simply plushible comfortability. The Lanai comes with two chairs and a table. The room comes with free internet via internet cable provided. Housekeeping comes twice a day, once in the morning to clean, and once in the evening to provide turn down service. I suggest leaving a couple dollars tip at least, and they will treat you right. Bell men insisted upon helping with the luggage, which we felt was very nice even though we were pretty much doing it ourselves anyway. They also have the Napua Tower, which has its own wing with it's own continental breakfast, and its own Hour d oevers and wine nightly, and also its own concierge. obviously we did not stay here, but passed by it on the way to our room everyday, and wondered about its amenities. it is available for extra dollars of course. The Service: Above Par: Now if you rent one of the cabanas for a cost on the lawn, you will have someone to wait on you and they will bring you frozen grapes all day, but we did not spend the money on the cabana. If you ask the waiter or waitresses for drinks while you are sitting in chairs though, they will gladly accomodate. We did not order too many drinks though because they are really expensive, which we knew going in (12 dollars/mixed drink). If you didn't know this going in, I guess I could see how you could react poorly, but when you go to a resort this size, you should really do a little research. We used chairs on the beach at no cost. Really, the cabanas were not worth the money unless you have a medical condition that prevents you from being in the sun. The Spa: All we heard about when we were at the Resort was how great the Spa was. We did not use it, but apprently it is rated one of the best around. We thought about it several times, but did not want to spend the extra money since we were spending so much already. Beach and Pools: Beach is rated best in the nation many times. I have even seen it on the Travel Channel at Home. Snorkel excursions visit nearby because of all the turtles, and because of it being such a great snorkel site. The beach is pretty much immaculate, with lawn and laying chairs available, nice white sand and fairly calm waters. The pool is in itself just freaking amazing. There are a bunch of pools on a $@!#%, and all are connected by several waterslides, two big ones being the main attractions. Between the two big waterslides is the worlds only water elevator, which takes you to the top of one of the big waterslides. We understood what we paid when we saw and rode in the water elevator. There is an adult habiscus pool which is luke warm rather than the cold water pools near the bottom. There are two adult hot tubs near the adult hibiscus pool, and there is also a massage therapist near the hibiscus pool which is avaiable for a charge. there are probably a total of 5-7 hot tubs, and also several pools. there is a kiddy beach for the kids right off of the regular beach, which is made to be safer, and is really a pool/beach for the children. There are lifeguards all around. The Land: They have about 15 million dollars put into their art work. They have tours of the resort for free just to view their art work if you like that sort of thing. They also have tours for the Flowers and landscape where they explain all that to you if you like that sort of thing also. Eating: We ate and drank very rarely at the hotels we stayed at because it was so expensive. The other hotel we stayed at was the Sheraton. It was also very very nice, and we would go back to either hotel, but the drinking and eating at both places was expensive, so we planned ahead wear to eat and drink by using Maui books bought in different stores. We sprang a little and ate breakfast once at the Grand Weilea in the Grand Dining Room the last morning we were there. My wife is a big breakfast fan, so we tried it. It was $28 pp, and even though it was a huge breakfast, and it included a lot of food, it still was not worth the dollars. That is why we planned ahead to eat off of the resorts. Other: Most people we talked to did not leave the resort, but we knew better. We did the Road to Hana, The Pipwai trail, another hike walk, and viewed many of the beaches North of Kannapali. We also did a Trilogy excurion for our Snorkel trip, and it took us to Molokini, where the water was clear about 50 feet down. We both agreed we had never seen water as clear before, and we have both snorkeled a couple of times before. Trilogy was awesome, fed us breakfast and lunch, and snacks in between, and was always asking us if we needed more to drink. I highly recommend Trilogy! You will need a car on the island if you are going off the resort. It is a negative if you do not get out of your hotel room. If you are not squeemish in the Car, do the Road to Hana, and go to the 7 Sacred Pools, and walk the Pipiwai trail (2 miles one way) Follow the pics and paragraphs in Maui Revealed. It was definitely our little blue book on this trip. Overall: If you go to Maui, I highly recommend that you do you reserach, and plan ahead. Otherwise, you will feel like a lot of others on this site that you were nickel and dimed beyond belief. If you don't expect to spend more than you think, then you will feel like you were shorted. We had an awesome Vacation staying at two hotels that were awesome. We expected to pay more than what we did up front, so expect that from the beginning. Email me for your questions or for pictures. I have a ton of them.\",\n",

We love Baltimore and all there is to do there, but more importantly than the town is the place -- and this is it! There is just this feeling of \"ahhh\" as you walk in, feeling like you\\'ve just entered the home of a dear friend. From the welcoming lobby (and front desk staff) to the wine in your room to the beautiful furnishings, you\\'ll know within ten minutes of your arrival that you picked the right place! The rooms are very large and furnished like a bedroom out of a model home. You will not feel in the least like you are staying in a hotel! The mattresses and sheets are top of the line -- you\\'ll get a wonderful night\\'s sleep! The breakfast is just incredible with every sort of fresh fruit, crunchy granola, a large assortment of fresh breads and pastries, cheese and crackers, many fresh fruits -- you name it, it\\'s there! I took pictures but somehow they got deleted from my camera card and I\\'m very disappointed because I\\'ve described this place to my friends, but it\\'s not until they saw the pictures on my camera that they realized how truly unique and wonderful this place is. The front desk staff will attend to your every need and are so gracious and pleasant to deal with. The Inn at Henderson\\'s Wharf combines the best of a Bed and Breakfast (charm, good food, warm ambiance) with the privacy and luxury of an upscale hotel. The water taxi comes within a few minutes of the front door -- it gets you wherever you want to go in Baltimore within minutes at a very low cost. We would never consider staying anywhere else when we\\'re in Baltimore and in fact consider the Inn a destination in itself!',\n",

This hotel has the smallest hotel room I have ever seen in the USA. Poor beyond words.

The hotel touts its own history and though nice, I was not particularly impressed overall. The Park Plaza seemed almost as though it was trying to be too many things to too many people...more than one wedding booked (large lighted ,glossy photos and names of couples in lobby detracting from the historic decor), lots of high maintenance vacationers, European travelers, even airline flight crews. Amid the shuffle, I felt a bit overlooked as a lone traveler. At one point, I waited in a long line for the Concierge to ask for a walkable map of the historic African-American sites trail, only to be told hurriedly that they didn\\'t have any but \"the trail starts on the other side of the park\". The group in front of me in line however, booked a boat tour, made dinner reservations for a family of 4, and got directions from the Concierge. All I wanted was a map. Maybe it would have been better had I not been traveling in the middle of the summer? In any case, the rooms have a nice historic flair (skeleton key doors) and are small but perfectly acceptable. The room was clean but my bed sheet was stained, which was pretty unexpected considering the caliber of the hotel. Overall, I could not have asked for a better location and for the seasoned traveler who needs little direction or attention, it was a reasonable choice.',\n",

Upon check in, there were no junior suites, so we were upgraded to some fabulous 2-room suite on the 15th floor of the Towers. It was lovely and the 15th floor suites include complimentary evening appetizers and morning breakfast. The 2-room suite accomodated us nicely and we were very gracious for the upgrade. However, the airconditioning would not go below 77-degrees (It was set to be 64-degrees when we arrived)!. Granted, on day one, Boston got hit by the near 100-degree heat wave. On day 2, i made 3 requests between 9 am and 10:45 pm for the AC to be looked at and i also requested a portable fan for the room. Sleeping night number one was miserable, difficult and hot! Anyhow, after my 3rd request for assistance, and it was now 11:15 PM and I needed to go to bed, so i walked down to the front desk and nicely explained my unhappiness and discomfort. The desk clerk appologized profusely and gave me her portable box fan from behind the counter. I was happy to have a fan at last, but displeased that my 3 earlier requests were disregarded. On day number 3 the room temp with AC would still only go down to 77, although the weather out was pleasant and mildat 78-degrees. We opened our windows and slept with them open because it was cooler out than in. All other aspects of the hotel were grand. The location right by a T station and 1 block from the Boston Public Garden can't be beat. The hotel is not cheap to stay at, and we were still paying a good chunk of change to stay there regardless of recieving an upgrade, so it is not accecptable to disregard a guests request for room comfort. Still, despite the AC situation, I would recommend this hotel and I would stay there again.\",\n",

I had the most wonderful massage on the 73rd floor Bliss spa (I used my Starwood points to pay for it.). The hotel is located in West Kowloon, a part of the International Commerce Center development, is in the heart of HK's financial district where you have access to all the shops and restaurants you'll ever need. You are also at the West Kowloon station of the MTR (subway) which is easy and convenient. Lastly, you can check in for most airlines right there for the In-town check in. (Meaning you can drop off your luggage right there!!) and take the airport train to the airport. A huge time savings. I will definitely stay here on future visits to HK.\",\n",

The room was spacious enough to ensure we were all comfortable, and everything was of very high quality. The cot for the baby was excellent and the big bed was super comfortable. Amenities were good and everything was fairly functional (though perhaps they do tend to err more on the side of design rather than functionality, but that's ok). Staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. They are obviously well trained and are keen to help customers. Food was fairly good. The only thing to consider carefully is the location. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere but does enjoy very good views of the harbour on one side (though partly obscured by the massive ICC tower) and is close to a shopping mall if that's what you're interested in. Everything is within quick reach by taxi though, and the hotel cars and drivers are also outstanding and affordable. Another odd arrangement is the reception... when you arrive you have to catch a lift to the 6th floor and get out. That's where reception is. Then you catch another lift to the room floors. A bit tiring after a while, especially when travelling with kids (though I'm being picky here). There was wireless internet but it wasn't cheap. Finally, you must check out the pool at the top. Fantastic spot with a stunning view! The pool was closed for a few weeks until January 20120 but is not open again. Overall, we had a great stay here, enjoyed the cool design and decor, as well as the great service and hospitality, and would probably recommend it to others.\",\n",

              "  'reviews': [{'content': 'My girlfriend and I decided to surprise our 11-year-old daughter with a trip to Seattle for her birthday this last weekend. She had never been and we knew she would love it. I actually went on a hotel discount site and was given this hotel. I had been in the Portland location once and remember it being beautiful and have stayed at other Kimpton hotels and had great experiences. After receiving notice of our reservation I emailed their staff and informed them this trip was for a birthday and requested a room with 2 beds, hopefully towards the top. The assistant manager promptly replied and said that he could accommodate that request but the 2-bed options were lower and didn\\'t have the best views. He then offered to upgrade us for $40 to one of the suites on the top floor. Given that we got such a good deal on the hotel price it was a no-brainer. The suite was excellent with a king bed in the bedroom and a pullout queen sleeper sofa in the living area. Both rooms had their own TV\\'s and there was a curtain that could be drawn to separate the two areas. The room was very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was nice but wasn\\'t as lavish as some other 4-star hotels we\\'ve been to. All of the soaps and shampoos though were high-end and there was nothing lacking. That night the hotel staff also left a note in our room with a birthday card for our daughter which included a free in-room movie rental as well as an invitation to call down for a complimentary birthday cake. We called down and they brought up a delicious personal-sized chocolate cake with ice cream and a candle in it. She was very excited! Throughout our 2-night stay the staff continued to be amazing. We spent a lot of our time checking out Seattle attractions but each time we came back we were greeted warmly. There was a wine tasting each night in the lobby and the staff always offered to get my daughter a soft drink from the restaurant. There were bowls of chocolates around that we all enjoyed as well. If I had anything to add to the \"con\" side it would be that the views from this hotel aren\\'t as attractive as some others I\\'ve stayed at in Seattle. It\\'s only an 11-story building and there are taller buildings surrounding it. If you\\'re expecting a full city view or one of the water you may be disappointed. We also thought the cost of valet parking was a little much, coming to nearly $40 per night with taxes. I am sure this is on-par with other 4-star hotels but is pretty hard to justify. We opted to valet on Friday night but found street parking on Saturday night since parking is free on Sundays. Overall though, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend staying there. Even with getting our reservation through a third party site we were never treated differently and that says a lot about a place.',\n",

              "   {'content': 'My wife and I decided to visit Seattle for a quick weekend trip to get away for our 20th anniversary. We always love staying at Kimpton hotels and have stayed at the Alexis Hotel and Hotel Vintage Park in Seattle, so this time we decide to try the Hotel Monaco. As expected, our stay was wonderful. When we arrived we were met by the bellman how helped with our luggage. This was helpful since we had brought our two Shih Thus with us. Check in was quick and in less than 5 minutes, the valet had our car and we were checked in and heading to our room. The room was very nice with a small living room that made it a little more than â€œjust a roomâ€�. We had room service the first night and the food was great and was delivered in less than 20 minutes. Evening turndown service got our room ready for the night including chocolates on the pillow. The hotel is in the perfect spot in Seattle because you can walk to Pikeâ€™s Market, the movies, the shopping center and even the tram to get you around town. The hotelâ€™s wine reception was great and we found others had brought their pets with them. Kimptonâ€™s â€œpet friendlyâ€� program is wonderful. We came back from running around one night and found a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our anniversary. Our three days went by much too fast and we really did not want to leave, but all good things must come to an end. The good news is we can always go back and know we will get great service.',\n",

              "   {'content': 'First impressions: The bellman and the front desk people both immediately demonstrated they were well trained and paying attention to their guests. The front desk lady provided great information (at a pace that was energetic but not rushed), helpful leading questions about the area, and major positive energy without bubbling or being insincere. The bellman was busy with another car when we arrived, but noticed the car in front right away and within a very short period met up with me at the reception desk to get the key from me. We stayed in one of the Monte Carlo suites -- great energizing decor. Comfortable living room area, seperated from bedroom by large drapes, which was great for reading the morning papers or sipping the wine from the lobby before heading out to dinner. The bath had plenty of counter space for both of us (though one sink). The bed was comfortable with a range of pillows, as well as seating arrangements including a nice, comfortable chair and a small, two person bench seat for shoes, dressing, etc. Our maid service did a great job with meticulous neatening up. We also had dinner one night in Sazarac, a New Orleans style restaurant where we encountered more of the same: normal people, working hard, to provide thoughtful, positive service. This included our host, who conscientiously got us a table and our waitress who was busy, friendly, informative and attentive. Monaco is a tremendous location: next door to Starbucks (though there is free coffee in the lobby in the mornings); a block from the Capitol Grill; and easy walking to the retail core. The room was very reasonably priced and we like service, but service at a bargain is even better!',\n",

              "   {'content': 'Just returned from 3 night stay over the Labor Day weekend at the Hotel Monaco Seattle. We met some friends of ours, who also stayed there in a separate room. The location was good for us and anyone who doesn\\'t have issues with moderate walking -- it was a multi-block walk to Pikes Market, the waterfront, etc. -- you do have up hill walking when you return to the hotel from Pikes Market or the waterfront, though we found some streets to be less steep than others (Union Street, for instance). From the moment we arrived at the hotel we found the staff to be friendly, professional and helpful, and this continued throughout our stay -- the valet, doorman, front desk reps, concierge, housekeeping, etc. Each time we were leaving the hotel, the front desk people would acknowledge us with pleasantries such as \"have a nice day\"; upon our return they would again acknowledge us with \"welcome back\", or something similar. The evening wine event in the lobby was a very nice touch. The overall feel of the hotel was that it was nicely decorated and clean and felt welcoming. The room was also nicely decorated and clean and larger than the average hotel room. There was ample comfortable seating, i.e. two upholstered chairs and a very comfortable desk chair at the large desk. Also, the room had multiple sources of bright lighting -- best lighting of any hotel we\\'ve stayed in. There was a nice size flat screen TV, stocked mini-fridge (items for purchase), stocked snack tray (also for purchase), and a room safe as well. Though coffee service is provided in the lobby each morning, there is no coffee service in the room, however, you can request a set-up for your room, if desired. The beds were extremely comfortable, i.e. the mattress, linens, comforter, and pillows. The air conditioner worked great and you are able to control the temp. to your liking from the in-room thermostat. The bathroom, too, was larger than usual. The shower head was to die for and with great water pressure, so you didn\\'t have to spend a longer-than-usual amount of time in the shower trying to shower with a trickle of water, as is the case in many hotels (especially important to those of us with longer, thicker hair). They also had a wall-mounted rack containing full-size pump bottles of shampoo, cream rinse, and liquid bath soap. A hair dryer was also provided. You should know ahead of time, as we did, that many of the rooms face directly towards another high rise, in close proximity, especially if you want a room with two beds versus a king; we were told that there are no two bed rooms not facing the building; besides not having a view or much natural light, this necessitates keeping your curtains closed for privacy -- but, again, at least there\\'s great lighting provided in the room. There are only two things I would add to my wish list for the hotel -- one is to have at least some two-bed rooms that don\\'t face a building and the second is to provide larger than the standard size bath towels. All in all, this was a terrific hotel experience and we will definitely return there on future trips. This was our first stay at a Kimpton Hotel but, based on this experience, it won\\'t be our last!',\n",

There were a couple issues with the service. We are members of the InTouch club and are supposed to get newspapers delivered to the room each day. We only got papers two of the five days. I asked the front desk after the fourth day, and they said \"well, there are other guests, and sometimes we run out, but there\\'s a whole bunch of papers over there against the wall\". Then, I didn\\'t get the paper the next day either. My young son was supposed to get a welcome gift as part of the InTouch club, but he received nothing. I asked about this the next morning, and they said there\\'s a box where kids can go chose something (we got a deck of cards). Also, for the morning tea/coffee service in the lobby, the black tea ran out very early each day as did the lemonade/tea in the afternoon. It seems there\\'s just a half hearted effort for these \"perks\". They should either support the service or not. Other than these things, the hotel was fine. The room was nice; the food in the restaurant was great. We loved our pet fish (Fred).',\n",

Here\\'s a tip - when you book your reservation, prior to your travel you will get a 2nd email from hotel with an area to submit an upgrade request. We used that link to upgrade, for free, to the Napua Tower. The Napua Tower is like the Executive Level. They have a good breakfast in the morning and appetizer in the evening. The service is great. House Keeping did a great job and our room was very clean. Another Tip - At The Whaler\\'s General Store in The Shops at Wailea (a short drive/walk from the Hotel) you can pick up some reasonably priced snacks, drinks and deli. I was surprised the prices on most items were cheaper than the local super markets in Kihei. Finally, the greeter at the front (Rose Sumibcay) was very cool. She was very kind and engaging and my 9 year old daughter looked forward to seeing her everyday to \"talk story\". Solid Vacation --- Hope to be back next year.',\n",

The pricing is what the pricing is and I feel that if you stay here you should have known that going in and thus you are not allowed to complain. I found the staff to be very pleasant individually but something just doesn't click here? It may be that it is so large that it all just doesn't connect, or come together as complete. The grounds are spectacular and easy to navigate, just be prepared to walk. Take in all that is around you, there is plenty to look at! The pool area was crowded but it was not a problem finding chairs, even after 11:00 am. There is limited space around any pool no matter how big, if you want to be pool front get up and get out! There was lovely lawn area with plenty of chairs and it was just fine and a short walk to the pools...just wear your $@!#% flops, as the walkway is sooo hot! Not the GW's fault! The beach is shared by 3-4 hotels and, though lovely, it is not huge and it gets packed!!! We went into the ocean but parked ourselves by pool and lawn. We ate at Humu and the pool area restaurant. Humu, with the $40 coupons was a fairly reasonable value and a great atmosphere. We had 3 rooms so we had $120 worth of coupons. Our dinner for 6, after coupons, was just over $200! This included some apps and drinks. Don't drink as much as us and use your free drink coupons with dinner, not before, and it is even less! We all felt it very good. The pool area food and bar was as expected, just fine. My daughter loved the spa treatment and, again after using the 20% off coupon, thought it was reasonable at about $125 for a 50 minute message and one hour use of other facilities included. The gym was large and we were there at peak time and waited for no machine. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable. We were in the back building and on the 6th floor and had a great view! I liked the bed though others with us thought they were to soft. If you take the down mattress cover off, or ask housekeeping to, it will be more firm. One thing to note, the lovely bathrooms were adorned with a throw rug that had no rubber backing in front of the sink!!! REMOVE IT if they have not yet changed them all out. I took a pretty good fall, after ignoring a slip or two prior. I was lucky to only twist my ankle and bruise my elbow pretty good- enough to miss my scheduled golf event with son. I can only imagine if it was someone older or less able to control the fall. I mentioned this to front desk and though my rug was immediately changed out to one with rubber backing the other two rooms we had were not! I was clearly not the first by the look on the faces of those I mentioned it to. Though I was looking for nothing, I was surprised by the apparent lack of concern when discussed with security. Would I stay again, yes I would. It was a lovely place.\",\n",

When I checked in I was told that the room I booked (two double beds) was not available due to \"damage\" and they had put us in an ovean front room with one King bed and a pull out couch. I as disappointed about the change, but they discounted the upgrade by $10.00 per night, which I appreciated. When we got to our room on the 6th floor it was clean but not up to the standards of a room we would normally stay in. If I had paid full price for the stay I likely would have checked out right then and went someplace else. The shower head was pulled from the wall, corner molding pulled from the wall, faucet was leaking/dripping and the room just felt run-down. You can read the other reviews about the place needing updates, I agree. THe best part of the room was the view of the ocean, and my children really enjoyed that. My older son appreciated the free wi-fi and it worked well for him. The pool area was great and my younger son and I spent most of our time there. They really seem to put alot of effort into making sure he outside of this hotel looks nice. I would suggest that they do all the pool maintenance and cleaning of the area before the pool opens at 8 am. I had to move all of my stuff one morning so that a maintenance guy could hose down/wash the windows in the meeting area. I think he should have done this before the pool opened. I found the front desk/restaurant/bar staff to be very friendly and interesting to talk to. The staff is likely the best part of the hotel, followed by the pool area. In the end, I am glad I got over my initial dislike of the place because it ended up to be a good stay. I hope they continue with the upgrades and improvements.',\n",

I checked in and asked for a quiet room was pleased to get an end room with a nice view, but it was right above very loud road construction and later had to endure very noisey drunks in bar on mezzanine right below me, I was told they would quiet down at 7pm, than 730 than maybe 930..was offered different rooms but all of the rooms had a very very noisey HVAC system that had a constant hummmm that was very annoying. I know from previous stays in nearby hotels the airplane noise is worse at other end Also was expecting a nice balcony but in reality it is only maybe 18\" wide, just enough to stand there. The good: Very good front desk, especially the women on 2nd shift (Silver?) decent bathroom, good bed, nice view, quick shuttle to the strip, room was fresh and not too heavy on air freshener like some places. The bad: Road traffic noise, road construction noise, airplane noise, noisey hum in room from hvac, noisey bar patrons in atrium, food and service in restaurant need some improvement, plates for breakfast buffet dirty, fitness center disapointing, two long black hairs in bathroom sink that were not mine, slight cigarette odor coming from bathroom vent',\n",

We are not into the Las Vegas scene at all so wanted a hotel without a casino. We have 5 children and were looking for something affordable. We came across Embassy Suites on Priceline and for a family of seven it worked great. The room had a living room/sm. kitchenette area and then a separate bedroom. The room would sleep 6 and we put the baby in his own playpen and also had the staff bring up a portable single bed. The kids loved the pool and their favorite part (and mine) was the made to order breakfast in the morning that was included in the price of the room. That kind of breakfast would have easily cost us $40 at a restaurant. We were cozy in the place but it certainly worked for the one night we stayed and was clean and comfortable and the staff was helpful and the hotel was very nice. The kids loved the glass elevators as well.\",\n",

In a previous review I had read a complaint about possible noise from the tram line that runs outside the hotel, so I made sure we got a room at the back. This was very quiet and luxuriously appointed with a lovely large bathroom with a bath. The breakfast was very good indeed with a good selection of fruits breads pastries juices and cereals. The scrambled egg and bacon did not look so nice though but the rest was great. There are some nice reasonably priced restaurants near the hotel. I found the hotel to be a little far from the centre to walk so we got taxis everywhere. You can get a train from the airport but we didn’t want the humping of cases on and off the train and through the station. (You are too close to get a taxi from the station just one block down from Termini) So it would have been lugging cases down the street to the hotel. We decided to get a taxi from Fumicino airport. This is fixed rate of 40 Euros which is not bad for the convenience. You have to get a ticket from a desk just before you go out the door of the airport to make sure you get the 40 Euro fixed rate, otherwise the taxi will be on the meter. The Hotel can arrange a luxury car back to the airport for 45 Euro which we took on departure. Impressions of Rome: Visit the main attractions about two in the afternoon to avoid the queues. We only queued for 15 mins at St Peters and the same at the Colliseum. The Vatican Museum we walked straight in. You may as well give the Trevi fountain a miss as it’s just a horde of tourists. The Sistine chapel was fantastic and the highlight of our stay. Be sure to read up all about the painting on the ceiling before you go to truly appreciate it.',\n",

However when I checked in at the Rome property I was given a very small room which with my son\\'s roll away bed was simply impossible. Returned to the desk and was told nothing could be done went back to the room and tried to rearrange the furniture and it was still not going to work. Returned to front desk and told the rather cold and abrupt clerk that the room was unacceptable period--I was a corporate reservation and requested to speak to the manager on duty. This lady didn\\'t speak English but took one look at the reservation and directed the supercilious desk clerk to put us in a nice two room suite which was great! Thank you very much. The biggest issue most people will have with the hotel is the location--about two blocks from the train station. Not a high rent neighborhood. In fact I watched a homeless guy sit in a doorway across the street for three days and nights. At the historic baths a few blocks away I saw the mobile health service van giving the homeless Heroin addicts their \"treatments\". However, I never felt uncomfortable walking the local streets even after dark and there are some reasonable eateries just around the corner. Being installed in a suite probably skews my review...there was some street noise at night and there is full time security personnel in the lobby to keep out the riff raff but I found it comfortable and convenient with a nice free breakfast. My wife didn\\'t care for the location but even she felt the room was nice--especially with the three of us in it. I\\'d stay again--she says I should find a better located B&B sort of place.',\n",

The famous Big Beach is only minutes drive away. The facility is very carefully maintained. We saw people polishing the door knobs and stair rails every day. The garden inside the hotel is just stunning. The hotel is also big, very big. It can be good or bad depending on peopleâ€™s taste. But we find it very interesting because there is a lot to explore. The room we had was a deluxe ocean view room. It is very clean and has all the amenities you can think of. We have nothing to complain about the staff. They are very helpful and very knowledgeable about what to do and where to go on Maui. The food in the resort is expensive. Thatâ€™s about the only drawback I can think of.',\n",

              "   {'content': \"This Resort was totally Posh! I cannot understand the negative reviews. Yes, the restaurants are expensive. Yes, they do charge a lot of money. Have you people looked around though? Everything on Maui is expensive, especially the hotels. Every hotel charges about double for drinks. If you go to a restaurant and bar off hotel premises, you will find it a lot cheaper. It is not just the Grand Weilea that charges extra for everything. We stayed at two Hotels on our stay, one which was less stars than the other, and both were comparable when it came to restaurant food and drink. My wife and I are middle class, and we stayed at this resort for 5 days. When we got to the resort, we checked ourselves in and parked our own car to save a little money. We parked our own car everyday, because they charge you money per day to use valet. When we were checked in, we were given a choice for an upgrade, either a king bed or two queens with an ocean view. We chose the ocean view, and what a spectacular view it was. Very Nice! We were very Pleased! The Parking lot is further away if you park yourself, but it was worth a few dollars saved. All resorts charge extra for their daily resort fee, and this is extra in addition to your trip fee, whether it is expedia, unitedvacations, or whatever, so expect it when you go. The Service: Excellent As said above, all you had to do was ask, and you were accomodated. We did not like the puffy pillows in the rooms, so we asked for flatter pillows in our room from housekeeping, and were immediately accomodated. On the beach, staff would help you grab chairs, give you as many towels as you wanted, and it was not too much trouble to ask for anything. Water was free all over the premises. they had tanks w/ cups everywhere. Everyone said hello, or Aloha, or Mahalo. The Room: We were upgraded to Oceanview with two Queens. The view was amazing, and the bathroom came with a two person soaking tub, and a glass enclosed shower, which could easily fit 3 persons if you wanted. Mini bar and frig accompanied the room, and it was very tempting not to use the mini bar, but it was just too expensive. We went to the Weilea village, and were able to buy liqour and beer for less than half the price of the mini bar contents. One should expect the mini bar to be high priced though. There are complimentary robes in the room. the beds are simply plushible comfortability. The Lanai comes with two chairs and a table. The room comes with free internet via internet cable provided. Housekeeping comes twice a day, once in the morning to clean, and once in the evening to provide turn down service. I suggest leaving a couple dollars tip at least, and they will treat you right. Bell men insisted upon helping with the luggage, which we felt was very nice even though we were pretty much doing it ourselves anyway. They also have the Napua Tower, which has its own wing with it's own continental breakfast, and its own Hour d oevers and wine nightly, and also its own concierge. obviously we did not stay here, but passed by it on the way to our room everyday, and wondered about its amenities. it is available for extra dollars of course. The Service: Above Par: Now if you rent one of the cabanas for a cost on the lawn, you will have someone to wait on you and they will bring you frozen grapes all day, but we did not spend the money on the cabana. If you ask the waiter or waitresses for drinks while you are sitting in chairs though, they will gladly accomodate. We did not order too many drinks though because they are really expensive, which we knew going in (12 dollars/mixed drink). If you didn't know this going in, I guess I could see how you could react poorly, but when you go to a resort this size, you should really do a little research. We used chairs on the beach at no cost. Really, the cabanas were not worth the money unless you have a medical condition that prevents you from being in the sun. The Spa: All we heard about when we were at the Resort was how great the Spa was. We did not use it, but apprently it is rated one of the best around. We thought about it several times, but did not want to spend the extra money since we were spending so much already. Beach and Pools: Beach is rated best in the nation many times. I have even seen it on the Travel Channel at Home. Snorkel excursions visit nearby because of all the turtles, and because of it being such a great snorkel site. The beach is pretty much immaculate, with lawn and laying chairs available, nice white sand and fairly calm waters. The pool is in itself just freaking amazing. There are a bunch of pools on a $@!#%, and all are connected by several waterslides, two big ones being the main attractions. Between the two big waterslides is the worlds only water elevator, which takes you to the top of one of the big waterslides. We understood what we paid when we saw and rode in the water elevator. There is an adult habiscus pool which is luke warm rather than the cold water pools near the bottom. There are two adult hot tubs near the adult hibiscus pool, and there is also a massage therapist near the hibiscus pool which is avaiable for a charge. there are probably a total of 5-7 hot tubs, and also several pools. there is a kiddy beach for the kids right off of the regular beach, which is made to be safer, and is really a pool/beach for the children. There are lifeguards all around. The Land: They have about 15 million dollars put into their art work. They have tours of the resort for free just to view their art work if you like that sort of thing. They also have tours for the Flowers and landscape where they explain all that to you if you like that sort of thing also. Eating: We ate and drank very rarely at the hotels we stayed at because it was so expensive. The other hotel we stayed at was the Sheraton. It was also very very nice, and we would go back to either hotel, but the drinking and eating at both places was expensive, so we planned ahead wear to eat and drink by using Maui books bought in different stores. We sprang a little and ate breakfast once at the Grand Weilea in the Grand Dining Room the last morning we were there. My wife is a big breakfast fan, so we tried it. It was $28 pp, and even though it was a huge breakfast, and it included a lot of food, it still was not worth the dollars. That is why we planned ahead to eat off of the resorts. Other: Most people we talked to did not leave the resort, but we knew better. We did the Road to Hana, The Pipwai trail, another hike walk, and viewed many of the beaches North of Kannapali. We also did a Trilogy excurion for our Snorkel trip, and it took us to Molokini, where the water was clear about 50 feet down. We both agreed we had never seen water as clear before, and we have both snorkeled a couple of times before. Trilogy was awesome, fed us breakfast and lunch, and snacks in between, and was always asking us if we needed more to drink. I highly recommend Trilogy! You will need a car on the island if you are going off the resort. It is a negative if you do not get out of your hotel room. If you are not squeemish in the Car, do the Road to Hana, and go to the 7 Sacred Pools, and walk the Pipiwai trail (2 miles one way) Follow the pics and paragraphs in Maui Revealed. It was definitely our little blue book on this trip. Overall: If you go to Maui, I highly recommend that you do you reserach, and plan ahead. Otherwise, you will feel like a lot of others on this site that you were nickel and dimed beyond belief. If you don't expect to spend more than you think, then you will feel like you were shorted. We had an awesome Vacation staying at two hotels that were awesome. We expected to pay more than what we did up front, so expect that from the beginning. Email me for your questions or for pictures. I have a ton of them.\",\n",

From the welcoming lobby (and front desk staff) to the wine in your room to the beautiful furnishings, you\\'ll know within ten minutes of your arrival that you picked the right place! The rooms are very large and furnished like a bedroom out of a model home. You will not feel in the least like you are staying in a hotel! The mattresses and sheets are top of the line -- you\\'ll get a wonderful night\\'s sleep! The breakfast is just incredible with every sort of fresh fruit, crunchy granola, a large assortment of fresh breads and pastries, cheese and crackers, many fresh fruits -- you name it, it\\'s there! I took pictures but somehow they got deleted from my camera card and I\\'m very disappointed because I\\'ve described this place to my friends, but it\\'s not until they saw the pictures on my camera that they realized how truly unique and wonderful this place is. The front desk staff will attend to your every need and are so gracious and pleasant to deal with. The Inn at Henderson\\'s Wharf combines the best of a Bed and Breakfast (charm, good food, warm ambiance) with the privacy and luxury of an upscale hotel. The water taxi comes within a few minutes of the front door -- it gets you wherever you want to go in Baltimore within minutes at a very low cost. We would never consider staying anywhere else when we\\'re in Baltimore and in fact consider the Inn a destination in itself!',\n",

              "   {'content': \"I booked a junior suite at the Park Plaza for our family vacation. Upon check in, there were no junior suites, so we were upgraded to some fabulous 2-room suite on the 15th floor of the Towers. It was lovely and the 15th floor suites include complimentary evening appetizers and morning breakfast. The 2-room suite accomodated us nicely and we were very gracious for the upgrade. However, the airconditioning would not go below 77-degrees (It was set to be 64-degrees when we arrived)!. Granted, on day one, Boston got hit by the near 100-degree heat wave. On day 2, i made 3 requests between 9 am and 10:45 pm for the AC to be looked at and i also requested a portable fan for the room. Sleeping night number one was miserable, difficult and hot! Anyhow, after my 3rd request for assistance, and it was now 11:15 PM and I needed to go to bed, so i walked down to the front desk and nicely explained my unhappiness and discomfort. The desk clerk appologized profusely and gave me her portable box fan from behind the counter. I was happy to have a fan at last, but displeased that my 3 earlier requests were disregarded. On day number 3 the room temp with AC would still only go down to 77, although the weather out was pleasant and mildat 78-degrees. We opened our windows and slept with them open because it was cooler out than in. All other aspects of the hotel were grand. The location right by a T station and 1 block from the Boston Public Garden can't be beat. The hotel is not cheap to stay at, and we were still paying a good chunk of change to stay there regardless of recieving an upgrade, so it is not accecptable to disregard a guests request for room comfort. Still, despite the AC situation, I would recommend this hotel and I would stay there again.\",\n",

I am a starwood gold member and was upgraded to an ocean view when i checked in. The staff were young, energetic,and helpful, the room was completely modern, clean, and comfortable. I had the most wonderful massage on the 73rd floor Bliss spa (I used my Starwood points to pay for it.). The hotel is located in West Kowloon, a part of the International Commerce Center development, is in the heart of HK's financial district where you have access to all the shops and restaurants you'll ever need. You are also at the West Kowloon station of the MTR (subway) which is easy and convenient. Lastly, you can check in for most airlines right there for the In-town check in. (Meaning you can drop off your luggage right there!!) and take the airport train to the airport. A huge time savings. I will definitely stay here on future visits to HK.\",\n",

The room was spacious enough to ensure we were all comfortable, and everything was of very high quality. The cot for the baby was excellent and the big bed was super comfortable. Amenities were good and everything was fairly functional (though perhaps they do tend to err more on the side of design rather than functionality, but that's ok). Staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. They are obviously well trained and are keen to help customers. Food was fairly good. The only thing to consider carefully is the location. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere but does enjoy very good views of the harbour on one side (though partly obscured by the massive ICC tower) and is close to a shopping mall if that's what you're interested in. Everything is within quick reach by taxi though, and the hotel cars and drivers are also outstanding and affordable. Another odd arrangement is the reception... when you arrive you have to catch a lift to the 6th floor and get out. That's where reception is. Then you catch another lift to the room floors. A bit tiring after a while, especially when travelling with kids (though I'm being picky here). There was wireless internet but it wasn't cheap. Finally, you must check out the pool at the top. Fantastic spot with a stunning view! The pool was closed for a few weeks until January 20120 but is not open again. Overall, we had a great stay here, enjoyed the cool design and decor, as well as the great service and hospitality, and would probably recommend it to others.\",\n",
