outer loop `i` iterates from the beginning of the list to the end of the list.\n    - The inner loop `j` iterates from the second element of the list to the end of the list minus `i` (excluding the element at position `j` itself).\n    - Inside the nested loops, it compares the elements at positions `j` and `j+1` in the list.\n    - If `arr[j]` is greater than `arr[j+1]`, it swaps the elements at positions `j` and `j+1` in the list.\n    -\n\n##########\nPrompt:\nWhat are the planets of the solar system?\nOutput:\n\n\nSure, here's a summary of the planets of the solar system:\n\n**Inner Planets:**\n\n* **Mercury:** The smallest planet, with a thin atmosphere and a surface covered by volcanic plains and mountains.\n* **Venus:** The hottest planet in the solar system, with a thick atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, and a surface covered by volcanic plains and hot springs.\n* **Earth:** Our home planet, with a thin atmosphere, liquid water, and diverse weather patterns.\n* **Mars:** The fourth planet from the Sun, with a thin atmosphere, a rusty surface, and evidence of past water activity.\n\n**Outer Planets:**\n\n* **Jupiter:** The largest planet in the solar system, with a massive atmosphere composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, and a powerful storm called the Great Red Spot.\n* **Saturn:** The second-largest planet, with a beautiful ring system composed of dust and ice particles.\n* **Uranus:** The third-largest planet, with a thin atmosphere and a unique shape that resembles a pear.\n* **Neptune:** The fourth-largest planet, with a thick atmosphere composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, and a strong wind called the Great Dark Spot.\n\n**Other Objects:**\n\n* **Moon of Earth:** The Moon is the only known natural satellite in the solar system that is larger than a planet.\n* **Moon of Jupiter:** The Galilean moon of Jupiter is the largest moon in the solar system.\n* **Moon of Saturn:**\n\n##########\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":11}]}
